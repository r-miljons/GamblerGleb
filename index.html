        <p>Recently, Gleb turned 18 years old and to his surprise, his parents, without telling him anything about it, have been investing their hard earned money into Gleb's trust fund which Gleb gained access to as soon as he turned 18!
        <br>Shortly soon after Gleb decided to quit high school "cuz it's for losers anyway" and pursue his dream of being a rich guy. 
        <br>Armed with his knowledge of "counting stacks and making it rain" and inspired by his idol - Dan Bilzerian from YouTube, he goes all in and heads straigth for the dream.</p>
