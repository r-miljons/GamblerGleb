My first project about JS and DOM manipulation, a little gambling game.

### 1. Gameplay description
 * You start with a set amount of Money and a full Sober-o-Meter (Meaning you're 100% sober).
 * Set the amount of Money you want to Bet.
 * Click on the bottle to Buy a drink to reduce your Sober-o-Meter. 
 * Sober-o-Meter multiplies how much money you win and lose, empty meter means maximum multiplication. 
 * With time the Sober-o-Meter goes back to being full, thus reducing your risk. 
 * Pull The Lever to start the The Slot Machine.
