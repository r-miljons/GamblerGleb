# GamblerGleb ♦♥♣♠

My first project using JavaScript, a little gambling game. I made it as soon as I learned about the Document-Object-Mbodel - using JavaScript to change, add and remove HTML elements, add or remove CSS properties and animations. I had a lot of fun making it, it was educational and challenging!
