My first project about JS and DOM manipulation, a little gambling game.

# 1. Gameplay description
 * You start with a set amount of Money and a full Sober-o-Meter (Meaning you're 100% sober).
 * Set the amount of Money you want to Bet.
 * Click on the bottle to Buy a drink to reduce your Sober-o-Meter. 
 * Sober-o-Meter dictates how much Money you can Bet and win, the less in the meter the more you can. 
 * With time the Sober-o-Meter goes back to being full, thus reducing your betting and winning power. 
 * Pull The Lever to start the The Slot Machine.
