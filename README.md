My first project about JavaScript and Document-Object-Model manipulation, a little gambling game. I made it as soon as I learned about using JavaScript to change, add and remove HTML elements.

### Gameplay description
 * You start with a set amount of Money and a full Sober-o-Meter (Meaning you're 100% sober).
 * Set the amount of Money you want to Bet.
 * Click on the bottle to Buy a drink to reduce your Sober-o-Meter. 
 * Sober-o-Meter multiplies how much money you win and lose, empty meter means maximum multiplication. 
 * With time the Sober-o-Meter goes back to being full, thus reducing your risk. 
 * Pull The Lever to start the The Slot Machine.

### Features
* A skippable tutorial/walkthrough explaining the rules of the game .
* A Fully working Slot Machine with an interactive Lever.
* Ability to place and change the amount of Money you Bet.
* Interactive Bottle and a Sober-o-Meter displaying how sober or rather not you are.
